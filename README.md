# Node SSL bench

This project is created to test HTTPS performance of two most popular node frameworks Fastify and Express.

I have [another benchmark repo] where I tested various technologies for developing web servers api.
The learning from this benchmark proven that NodeJS is quite performant choice which I did not expected.
